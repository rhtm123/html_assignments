        <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            It can be assisted by technologies such as <i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) </i> and scripting languages such as <i>JavaScript</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the 
            documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
        </p>

        <p>Text can be <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, or <del>strikethrough</del>.</p>


        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            In 1980, physicist <em>Tim Berners-Lee </em>, a contractor at CERN , proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE,
             a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
